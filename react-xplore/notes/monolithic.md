# Monolithic
**Monolithic architecture** refers to a software design approach in which all the components of an application are tightly integrated into a single unit or codebase. In a monolithic system, the entire application is typically built, deployed, and scaled as one piece, without the separation of concerns seen in other architectural styles like microservices.

### Key Characteristics of Monolithic Architecture:
1. **Unified Codebase**: All features and functions (e.g., user interface, business logic, database access) are part of a single codebase.
2. **Single Deployment**: The entire application is deployed together, meaning any change or update affects the whole system.
3. **Tightly Coupled**: The components within the application are interdependent and communicate directly within the same environment.
4. **Single Database**: Often uses one central database that all parts of the application interact with.

### Advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to design and develop initially because everything is in one place.
- **Performance**: Communication between components is generally faster due to the tight coupling and absence of network overhead.
- **Easier Testing**: Since the components are together, testing can be more straightforward in some cases.

### Disadvantages:
- **Scalability**: Scaling a monolithic application can be difficult because it requires scaling the entire system rather than individual components.
- **Flexibility**: Changes in one part of the application can affect other parts, making it harder to modify or scale specific features without impacting the whole system.
- **Complexity Over Time**: As the application grows, managing the codebase can become cumbersome, making it harder to update, debug, and maintain.

### Example:
An online shopping website might have all of its functionalities—like user authentication, product catalog, checkout, and payment processing—inside a single monolithic codebase. Every time a developer needs to add a feature or fix a bug, they must deploy the entire application.

Monolithic architecture is commonly used in simpler or smaller applications, but for larger, more complex systems, alternative architectures (like microservices) may be preferred to overcome scalability and maintenance challenges.
